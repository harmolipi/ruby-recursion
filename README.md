# Ruby Recursion
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

### Functionality

This is the [recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion) project, consisting of a recursive Fibonacci sequence warmup, and a recursive merge sort exercise.

### Thoughts

Woah, this one felt like a rollercoaster. I truly had quite a bit of trouble wrapping my mind around recursion in the merge sort method, but it was extremely satisfying when it all finally clicked. I utilized all of the resources The Odin Project made available, and then it all finally clicked when I used pry to step through my code sequentially and see exactly what was happening. I made a few small tweaks to my initial failed attempts, and finally it worked.

God bless.
